# Trie-Search-Tree---A-Digital-Tree-Data-Structure
This repository hosts an implementation of one of the most interesting Data Structures: Trie Search Tree.


I also would like to extend this space with possible information I can dig through about this particular Data Structure. Feel free to fork for future references!

# Digital or Prefix Tree Data Structure

Trees are one of the most promising areas in the context of Data Structures. Binary Tree, Binary Search, Balanced Trees (in case of a Binary Search Tree losing its balance): AVL or Red-Black trees.
Trie Search Tree is so much like any other tree except it handles data in a way that is more flexible in terms of Insertion and Search at a Linear Time complexity, which probably depends on the length of the word. Some merits includes Auto-Complete Search and printing in Alphabetical order in case of letters.
